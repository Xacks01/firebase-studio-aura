- Background color: Very light Green (#F0FFF0). A desaturated, bright shade that aligns with the 'light green or pastel tones' mentioned, offering a calm background.
- Accent color: Light Blue (#ADD8E6). An analogous color to light green. With less brightness and more saturation than the background, the accent brings an element of contrast, which may be suitable for the testimonial cards as requested by the user.
- Use modern, sans-serif fonts for all text elements.
- Maintain ample white space between sections and elements to enhance readability and provide a clean, uncluttered user experience.
- Use simple and minimalistic icons to represent various sections and actions.
- Implement smooth scrolling and subtle transitions between sections.
